## Quick Start
1. Go to [DirectMe Website](https://directme-eta.vercel.app/) and click Sign Up to create account.
2. You only need to provide a username and password. There's no need to confirm any emails since this is not a commercial project and doesn't require an additional layer of security.
3. If you sign in, you will be redirected to login page here just type provided before username and password and you are in.
